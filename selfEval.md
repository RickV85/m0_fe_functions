# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?

I think I spend the most time on what I think is difficult or complex to make sure that I understand what I am doing. I typically like to understand why I got the right answer and experiment to see how different input changes my results.

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?

A function is like a little program that can be written to tell you any sort of information about a set of data.

- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.

When setting up and executing functions, the "parameters" are like variables exclusive to the function you are working with. The "arguments" are the pieces of data that need to be provided to fill in the "parameters" and display (or whatever else you want to do with) the data in the way that you have defined in the function.

- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?

I think these are very interesting! I would like to see some others ways that functions are used. I feel like these are pretty powerful and probably can do a lot!
